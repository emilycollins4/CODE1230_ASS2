	<p>Through the observation of the 2016 data set showing the weekly income of males between the ages of 25 and 35 in Sydney, 
	the darker blue areas have lower weekly income and the lighter green/yellow areas are the highest income areas.
	Areas in the Eastern Suburbs as well as in the City have higher weekly income rates, as well as in industrial areas 
	due to a higher population of men and higher paying jobs. Expensive areas in the North Shore and around beaches
	are mostly green/blue not because of a lower income but because they are largely populated by families and
	retireees.</p>
